# Athenaeum

Sharing your favorite books has never been easier.
What [Athenaeum](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/athenaeum) brings to the table is the ability to login and create a repository of your favorite books, you will be able to share your favorite books with other users on the platform, and find users who are into similar books as yourself. You'll be able to see trending books so you can always stay up-to date with what books might be enjoyable for you to read based on your likes.
Athenaeum will implement a minimalistic design to allow for functioninal UI design choices.

## Front End

Our front-end is driven through [React](https://reactjs.org/). React allows for improduced productivity, and is kept up-to-date. It is SEO friendly allowing for a lot more scalable options. React-Native is also available for mobile if it is decided that if we decide to make it more mobile.

## Back End

Our backend is driven through [Go](https://golang.org/). Go is a language that is fast, easy to use, contains static typing, interface types, a standard library. Extremely good testing support is also a big driving factor to ensure that our code is working as intended. On top of using go, we willl be more specifically using [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). THis allows for much faster http routing.

## Infrastucture

We will be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). Docker will allow us to create necessary containers, figure out deployment and run-time issues. It includes encapsulation, isolation, portability and control. They have their own built-in mechanisms for versioning and component reuse.

## UI Design

[Semanti UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) will be used as our CSS Framework. It allows for theme, a slew of icons, and various other CSS needs.
